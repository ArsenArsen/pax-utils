Fix these warnings when building on arm/hppa/ia64/sparc:
scanelf.c: In function `scanelf_file_textrel':
scanelf.c:241: warning: cast increases required alignment of target type
scanelf.c:242: warning: cast increases required alignment of target type
due to:
	dyn = DYN ## B (elf->data + offset); \
	rel = REL ## B (elf->data + EGET(shdr[s].sh_offset)); \
	rela = RELA ## B (elf->data + EGET(shdr[s].sh_offset)); \
	sym = SYM ## B (elf->data + EGET(symtab->sh_offset)); \

pspax -u 0
errno = 0; uid = strtol(optarg, NULL, 10); if (uid == 0 && errno != 0) error("invalid value");

add support for RPATH checking with -nL ?

we truncate 64bit types in many places to (unsigned long) ... do we really
care though ?  this would be an issue if:
 - host is 32bit
 - object being analyzed is 64bit
 - object has symbols which is larger than 32bits
